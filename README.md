Project Name: Library Management System (Java)

Project Description:
This is a console-based Java application designed to manage a library system.
The program allows users to add new books, view all books, issue books to students, and return books.
It also saves library data using file handling so that all information is preserved even after closing the program.
The project demonstrates core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects), ArrayList, File I/O, and Exception Handling.

Key Features:

Add new books with a unique ID, title, and author

View all books with details and availability status

Issue books with status validation

Return books and update their availability

Save and load data using file handling for persistent storage


Learning Outcome:

Implemented real-world library management functionality using Java

Practiced OOP principles, ArrayList operations, and file handling

Learned to handle exceptions and user inputs safely

Gained experience in building beginner-level console-based applications


Tools & Technologies:

Core Java

Object-Oriented Programming

ArrayList

File I/O (Serialization)

Console-based interface


Role:
I developed this project independently to strengthen my Java programming skills and prepare for Zoho’s examless selection process.
